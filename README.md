ARP Spoofing Attack Simulation & Mitigation Analysis 


Objective: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks within a controlled lab environment.


Environment & Tools: GNS3, VirtualBox, Kali Linux, Wireshark, dsniff (arpspoof), Cisco IOS .

Key Activities:

Designed and configured a network topology featuring Cisco routers, an attacker node (Kali), and a victim machine (Windows 10).

Executed ARP Poisoning to redirect network traffic through the attacker's interface.

Captured and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark to intercept credentials from unencrypted HTTP POST requests.

Implemented and verified defensive measures, including Static ARP entries and Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI).


Outcome: Successfully demonstrated the vulnerabilities of the ARP protocol and verified the effectiveness of encryption (HTTPS/SSH) and static configurations in preventing data interception.
